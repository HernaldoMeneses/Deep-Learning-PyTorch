#Where PyTorch fits into the current and historical landscape of deep learning tools.
# Until the late 2000s
##  "machine learning" relied heavily on feature engineerig.
### Features are tranformations of input data resulting in numerical features that facilitate a downstream algorithm
### , such as a classifier, to produce correct outcomes on new data.

# Deep learning
## on the other hand, deals with finding such representations automatically, from raw data, to perform a task successfully.
